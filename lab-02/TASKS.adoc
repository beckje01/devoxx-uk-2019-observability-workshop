== Zipkin Support For Services
We want to start adding Zipkin tracing for all our services to better deal with debugging. You should see all of your services in the service list in zipkin.

* _Ratpack_- https://github.com/openzipkin-contrib/brave-ratpack[brave-ratpack]
* _Micronaut_ - https://guides.micronaut.io/micronaut-microservices-distributed-tracing-zipkin/guide/index.html[Micronaut Tracing Support]
* _Spring Boot_ - https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-sleuth[Sleuth]

== DataStore Tracing
We can also wrap our datastores with tracing to really find hidden issues. For this project the https://github.com/p6spy/p6spy[P6Spy] is a good start

== Debug Issues
There are some routing issues embedded in the apps that should show themselves very easily with tracing. You should be able to fix them.

== Debug slow transactions
There is a slow transaction hiding which should show nicely on zipkin; after you find it fix it.
