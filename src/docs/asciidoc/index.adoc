== How this Workshop is Setup

Labs are in a state where they will compile but not all are 100% correct. The answers are in the corresponding modules.

=== System Overview

[plantuml%interactive, _images/diagramoverdev, svg, height=350, width=400]
----
@startuml
  rectangle edge as "Edge"
  rectangle hub as "Hub"
	rectangle user as "User"
	rectangle report as "Report"
	database hubdb as "Hub\nDatabase"
	database userdb as "User\nDatabase"

  user -down-> userdb
  hub -down-> hubdb

  edge -down-> report
  edge -down-> hub
	edge -down-> user

	report -> hub

=== Infra

All the shared infrastructure for observability is in this directory you can run it with docker-compose.

=== Requests

A handful of simple requests that can exercise the system easily are in this directory. Each service has a file.

=== Services

Each service is named for its role then a dash with it's framework. You only need to run one of each role.


=== Task List

There is a high level task list in each lab directory, that has a rough order on the things to explore. It also has general pointers of where to get started.

=== Wrap Up

We will do a wrap up discussion after each lab talking about more complex real world applications of the topics.

== What is Observability

The property of systems that allows operators to clearly understand the state of the system.

=== Show and Tell

== Lab 01 - Logging

=== Commands

From infra dir:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

From each project directory
```
./gradlew run
```

=== Lab 01 - Tasks

. Get Logs to One Place
. Dynamic Log Filtering
. Log Formatting
. Correlation IDs

*GOAL* All Logs Available in Kibania

=== Lab 01 - Wrap Up

* Correlation IDs are lightweight, good for small retrofit
* Dynamic Logging is for cost savings
* Formatting Matters

== Tracing Terminology


=== What is Distributed Tracing

Distributed tracing systems collect end-to-end latency graphs
(traces) in near real-time.

* https://zipkin.io/[Zipkin]
* https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger[Jaeger]
* https://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html[Dapper]

=== Terminology Lesson

* **Span** - An operation that took place.
* **Event** - Something that occurs in a span.
* **Tag** - Key value pair on a span.

=== Terminology Lesson

* **Trace** - End-to-end latency graph, made up of spans.
* **Tracer** - Library that records spans and passes context
* **Instrumentation** - Use of a tracer to record tasks.
* **Sample %** - How often to record a trace.

== Lab 02 -- Tracing

Same apps just add tracing.

=== Lab 02 - Tasks

. Zipkin Support For Services
. DataStore Tracing
. Debug Issues
. Debug Slow Transactions

=== Lab 02 -- Wrap Up

* Customization is Key
* Service Mesh
* When to use annotations?
* When to use tags?

== Lab 03 -- Metrics

=== Lab 03 - Tasks

. Expose Metrics for Prometheus
. Scrape All the Metrics
. Custom Metrics

=== Lab 03 -- Discussion

* What metrics do you collect today?
* How do metrics lie to you?
* How do your metrics tie to users?

== Lab 04 -- Observability Bugs

=== Lab 04 -- Tasks

. Odd Behaviors

=== Lab 04 -- Error Stories

* Traces with > 10k spans
* Error rates thrown off by service reporting the wrong name.
* Lost traces
* Broken Traces
* Fixed correlation IDs

== Observability Discussion

* Data is step 1
* Actionable data is step 2
* Pair all the tools for maximum effect.
